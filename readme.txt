== PHPUnit tests for Wolf CMS ==

These are the PHPUnit tests for Wolf CMS. Current status of the tests is very
dirty, simplistic and basic.

The setup of the tests make certain assumptions, mostly path related. These
paths can be found in bootstrap.php

When adding new tests, they should not contain paths and environment specific
information. All environment specific data should go into bootstrap.php
